Alternate way to compile:

*please make sure that you are in the correct directory*.

#### Open a terminal and type these commands: <br>
- javac Server.java <br>
- java Server <br>
#### Now, open a new terminal and type this command: <br>
- python client.py <br>

The GUI should open in a new window. It will prompt you with a username, host, and port. 

Please choose any username. The host is localhost, and the port will be given to you in the first terminal. <br>
